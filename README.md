StaffTonnetz
============
Alternative music notation software.

StaffTonnetz is a shape-note system for the 12-tone Equal Tempered (12-TET) chromatic scale based on Euler's "Tonnetz." 
It consist of twelve distinct noteheads with 4 distinct orientations and 3 distinct fill patterns arranged in two overlapping (NOT NESTED) cycles, such that every third note (minor third interval) has the same fill and every fourth note (major third interval) has the same orientation.
StaffTonnetz is being implemented as a font in fontStruct: see http://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/stafftonnetz1b
and as a stencil file in LilyPond.

As a font, StaffTonnetz also includes characters for creating rests and staff lines (staff lines running vertically on the page), allowing creation a rudimentary music notation as a TEXT FILE.  I have applied this to an alternative notation with a 5-line 7-space staff corresponding to the piano keyboard.

Lilypond glyphs can be substituted for standard noteheads for shape-note music or for other alternative notation.  For alternative notation possibilities, see musicnotation.org
